# ObsidianGPT Assistant

This is an Obsidian Plugin that allows its users to use OpenAI prompts to enhance their learning experience.

This was developed mainly using Typescript and depends on the latest Obsidian plugin API.

**Note:** ObsidianGPT is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!
